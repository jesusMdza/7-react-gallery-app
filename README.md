Project: 
ReactJS Gallery Application

This SPA (Single Page Application), with the power of React, allows the user to search through Flickr's API for any photo they wish to find. The amount of photos displayed is limited to 24 photos per search. Preset nav links are given as default options to search for. Each photo is displayed in a nice eye appealing masonry grid.

Because this is an app that fetches data which can be prone to errors on flickr's end, user feedback is a must. Error messages are provided to show what went wrong with the user's search (404 error/ Bad search).


If you downloaded the project files, you must provide your own api key from flickr inside the axios request. After that, you're set! Run 'npm start' to run the app.
